# Contributing to GPTUI

The GPTUI project welcomes contributions from developers and users in the open source community.
Contributions can be made in a number of ways, a few examples are:

- Code patches via pull requests
- Documentation improvements
- Bug reports and patch reviews

Some of GPTUI's plugin features rely on prompt, you can continue to help me improve these prompt.
And I'd like to have appropriate animation cues during certain state changes.
If you have any creative ideas, I'd appreciate your help in implementing them.
